## Introduction
Grasshopper is a powerful visual programming language and environment that is widely used in the fields of architecture, design, engineering, and computational design. The ghPython plugin allows you to leverage the flexibility and expressiveness of Python within Grasshopper, enabling you to create custom components and automate various tasks.

This repository serves as a central hub for sharing and distributing ghPython components created by the community. It aims to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation, allowing users to learn from each other and accelerate their Grasshopper workflows. For now there is no general theme in terms of the "types" of components or the catagory of problems they intend to solve, see it as a brain dump for anything usefull combination of operations or algorythms that you might find kind of nifty.

## Why not compiled c# plugins you might ask?
Well, transparency. And yes I could have made the repo open source aswell allowing you to look at all the fancy pancy c# code I have written but I think having access to the code IN THE ENVIRONMENT that you are working in makes it all the more transparent and easily modifiable and deployable without needed to build any solutions. Disclaimer, this is not a dis on c# plugins, they are awesome, but thats not what this repo is intended to serve. :D


## Getting Started
To get started with the ghPython components in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Grasshopper and create a new Python script component.
3. In the Python script component, access the `Edit Script` option.
4. Copy the code from the desired ghPython component in this repository.
5. Paste the code into the Python script component.
6. Customize and connect the component as needed for your specific use case.
7. Enjoy the added functionality and explore new possibilities!

Please note that you need to have Grasshopper and the ghPython plugin installed to use the components in this repository.

## Contributing
We welcome and encourage contributions from the community to enhance this repository and make it a valuable resource for Grasshopper users worldwide. If you have a ghPython component that you would like to share, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your component.
3. Add your ghPython component to the appropriate category folder.
4. Include a README.md file in your component folder, providing a description, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.
5. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request, explaining the purpose and benefits of your contribution.

By contributing to this repository, you are helping to expand the knowledge base and empower the Grasshopper community with valuable tools and resources.

## Component Categories
This repository organizes ghPython components into several categories to facilitate easy exploration and discovery. The categories include:
- Geometry: Components related to geometric operations, transformations, and calculations.
- Data Manipulation: Components for manipulating and analyzing data in Grasshopper.
- Automation: Components that automate repetitive tasks or complex workflows.

Feel free to navigate through the repository and explore the components in each category. If you have ideas for additional categories or suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback!
